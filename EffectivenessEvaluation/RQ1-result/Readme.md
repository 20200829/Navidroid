Activity coverage by STG_action 

We compared our NaviDroid with five baselines, For more details, see ./EffectivenessEvaluation/.
We also try the other fine-grained metric, the number of unique states explored by the tool. In our experiments, we also get the result in 85 apps from our dataset, as seen in the table below. On average, Navidroid can get 52.7 states which is 27% higher than the best baseline. We had omitted the results from the submitted version for space reasons, but are happy to include them for camera-ready.
